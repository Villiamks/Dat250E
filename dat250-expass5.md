# Dat250 expass5

### execution:
I did not encounter any big problems in my installation of
valkey. The only problem I had was with Intellij that did
not recognize the dependency I putt in the build file, to 
fix this I only needed to refresh gradle. 

### Pending issues:
I have not gotten the front-end to work with the 
implementation of this cache, and I don't know if the 
problem is in the api or the front-end itself. All my
created tests pass, however I do not have test for 
these specific functions.
