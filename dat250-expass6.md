# Dat250 Expass 6

### Execution: 
First I followed the tutorials on RabbitMQs page, but I had
some problems figuring out what and where to implement these
functions as the examples all wrote the code directly in the
main function. To figure this out I both found some help on
stackoverflow, but mostly I asked AI for direction on where
to implement what. I have not created a test for this but my
previous tests still all pass.
